This one felt much better and I got to meet a few different people one-on-one as well as worked on a little bit of code in a more collaborative sense. A few hour interview still can not be considered anything but stressful, but as far as interviews go, I had fun and loved the company and people I met."

They helped me. It was not that bad. I celebrated my first techinical interview with blueberry coffee cake and a cappuccino."

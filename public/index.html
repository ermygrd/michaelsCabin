            <h2>Practice with React</h2>
            <h5>December 24, 2016</h5>

                    <p>Another technical interview done and it's time to practice. This one felt much better and I got to meet a few different people one-on-one as well as worked on a little bit of code in a more collaborative sense. A few hour interview
                        still can't be considered anything but stressful, but as far as interviews go, I had fun and loved the company and people I met.</p>
                    <p>If I land the internship, I wouldn't have the 2 week lead time that interns usually get so I figured I'd start now. Currently going through some tutorials to learn React and making little thingamajigs (aka components) hosted on my
                        github page since that was a novel idea. I'll probably try to integrate a comments section for this blog eventually, but for now check it out here: </p>

                    <p>Today I had my first technical interview. I was asked to do something so simple, I literally had already done it for the code challenge to get the interview, I panicked. They helped me. It wasn't that bad. I celebrated my first techinical
                        interview with blueberry coffee cake and a cappuccino.</p>
                    <p>I have to finish what I started so here is a made-from-scratch js carousel containing the code challenge.</p>

            <h2>Grace Hopper, I never knew what you would mean to me.</h2>
            <h5>October 19-21, 2016</h5>
            <div class="row">
                <article>
                    <p>I was fortunate enough to be selected to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference by my Professors at SBCC. I had never been to a conference of this size - 15,000 people. And I wasn’t sure exactly what to
                        hope for from the conference other than an internship or entry level job.</p>
                    <p>I researched in advance to figure out how to make the best of my limited time at the conference and decided to set goals for myself to make sure I was participating in the activities that would be most fulfilling to me. One of my goals
                        was to walk away with employment in tech, another was to make 3 new friends and another was to identify a mentor especially someone older than myself with experience.</p>
                    <p>The time flew by and I met many, many more friendly, engaging female engineers than I thought existed and walked away with a few friendships that I think could last a lifetime. I got a great impression of many companies I would like
                        to work for too. I was fortunate enough to attend the receptions for Amazon, Target and Google. What I took away from the receptions was the commitment these larger companies have to the actual well being of their employees and
                        finding qualified women to join their team. Like Astro Teller said at one of the talks, it’s about bringing the lipservice of what companies say they stand for closer to the reality of what companies actually do.</p>
                    <p>I was incredibly inspired by the talks and one thing in particular that stands out for me (that I almost want a tattoo of) is Ginni Rometty, CEO of IBM, saying that comfort and growth do not coexist. This gave me such a boost. I didn’t
                        have any larger than life role models before, but I do now.</p>
                    <p>The best thing I got from the conference? A huge boost in confidence and purpose from feeling like a part of something bigger, better and going to change the world.</p>

            <h2>LamPilert @ AT&T Hackathon</h2>
            <h5>October 14th, 2016</h5>
            <img class="image left" src="images/lampilertScreen05.jpg">
            <img class="image right" src="images/lampilertScreen07.jpg">
            <div style="clear:both; "></div>
            <p>LamPilert is a Raspberry Pi (get it? lam-PI-lert) LED lamp and paired Android app. I thought of this as a solution to the problem of constant interruptions from smartphones and the need to focus while not quite being able to shut the phone
                off completely. </p>
            <p><strong>The Team:</strong> Myself, Amalu Islandvillage, Ian Chidester, Daniel Luft-Martinez, and Anuja Upadhye</p>
            <p><strong>What does it do?</strong> LamPilert lights lamps throughout the house to send gentle reminders and help its user to remain focused while not being late for events. The LEDs are connected to a Raspberry Pi which receives commands from
                the app on their Android phone through a TCP server and wifi. The LEDs and Raspberry Pi were housed in repurposed objects found laying around the house. Future iterations will have custom 3d printed housing.</p>
            <p>Using a Raspberry Pi was overkill for our purposes, but since I had bought my first one the week before, I wanted to learn to use it as well as some of the components from my computer engineering club electronics kit. The Android app does
                all the heavy lifting using Google APIs to check the calendar for upcoming events, coordinating with Google Maps and current GPS location to send the signal lighting the lamp with different color indications.</p>
            <img class="image fit" src="images/lampilertScreen04.jpg">
            <p><strong>Teamwork makes the dreamwork.</strong> I was the de facto organizer and (dare I say) leader of the group having promoted the event to both CE and CS clubs on campus as well as rallying the group around my idea. We initially had 16
                people planning on attending, but last minute notification that the location closed at midnight meant that we lost many comrades who couldn’t handle the uncertainty. But we had 6 more die-hards willing to work at a 24 hour Denny’s if need
                be! Due to the limited time nature of Hackathons, we split the project into tasks and took advantage of Trello and GitHub for organization. Full credit goes to Anuja for the professional and beautiful UI design (<a href="http://www.anujaupadhye.com/lam-pi-lert/">Anuja
                s Blog</a>), Daniel for getting the groundwork for the Google APIs, Amalu for hooking up the Raspberry PIs and Ian for the TCP Server. Working as the glue of the group, I created the Android app to connect the pieces.</p>
            <p><strong>The results:</strong> Tangible results from this project at the AT&T Hackathon include 2nd place and working prototypes! But more importantly I was able to work with and learn from some amazing teammates as well as get inspired by
                the energy and competition present in the LA Tech scene. I used my Python and Java skills to make some cool stuff and got familiar with Android Studio. </p>
            <p>We learned some valuable lessons and one of the most important was getting the different components communicating before putting in too much time and effort.</p>
            <p>I am continuing to develop LamPilert and hope to have it on the Play Store as well as on Instructables to inspire others.</p>

            <h2>I learned to solder!</h2>
            <h5>October 7, 2016</h5>
            <div class="row">
                <article>
                    <p>I’m so glad I have gotten more involved with the clubs on campus. Today we had a soldering workshop and I had never done any soldering before. It was a small project that helped me to realize that things aren’t as hard as they seem.
                        I keep having this realization and I’m not sure exactly when it is going to sink in permanently.</p>
                    <p>I first had this realization when I was 6 and learned how to hook up the Super Nintendo. I thought it must be hard since my 16 year old brother or Electrician father were the only people that had done it before. But I wanted to play
                        and it was disconnected from the TV, so I had to figure it out or not play Donkey Kong at all. Guess who figured it out?</p>
